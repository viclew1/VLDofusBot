List of differences between FFDec and official compiler
--------------------------------------------------------
- Maximal stack count in method body can be lower in FFDec as official compiler in some cases calculates it wrong (e.g. increments and set/get property).
- In names of type Multiname(L/LA), namespaceset can have namespaces in different order, this is because official compiler generates
  this based on constructor position inside class
- XML literal has different rules for string addition
