# VLDofusBotCore

VLDofusBotCore gathers bot core content. These are :

- Dofus file managers for d2o, d2p and amf3 (information about maps, characteristics, fight cells, ...)
- Utils for reading Dofus content, may it be network (for VLDofusBotSniffer) or file content (for d2o/d2p)
- Logger tools

### How to use

When using VLDofusBotCore, first call `VLDofusBotCoreUtil.initAll()` for setting d2o and d2p managers up. Then, you're
free to go.
