# VLDBot - DISCONTINUED

Welcome to [VLDBot](https://vldbot.com)!

Its goal is to help you automatize tedious tasks in Dofus. This is not a socket bot, it will sniff the network to read the game's packets and will simulate clicks on the game window. No message will be sent to the game server directly by the bot.

VLDBot is a sniffer bot. It works alongside the official game client by sending it clicks and keystrokes and doesn't put itself in between the game client and server.

This means that you don't need any kind of custom client to use it, and that you can very easily run automatized actions to support your manual gameplay, or completely leave it to the bot. It's up to you!

**The code of the bot is now private, if you want to download it, head to the website https://vldbot.com, or you can also get the latest release on GitHub!**
